# portafolioVanillaJS_SPA_arquitecture
As the title says, this repo has my portafolio in vanilla JS BUT  following the SPA arquitecture

OPEN THIS PROJECT WITH LIVESERVER OR ANY OTHER TOOL OF THAT KIND. IF NOT, IT IS NOT GOING TO EVEN SHOW THE HTML

IMPORTANT -----> To run this portafolio, previously you needed to open db.json using json-server. To make the testing easer I added an object called lenData to Router.js which contains that info.
